## 2. Setting students up
Setting students up with their project may require considerable up front effort, but is an extremely important part of the project process. Taking the time to help students plan and layout their project in the beginning will give them and you a road map to follow as you work through their project together. Setting students up with projects is also intentionally designed to be a highly collaborative process between the instructor and the student.

  1. Start the project setup process with a conversation with the student about the project. Start by finding out what the student is interested in. Coming up with a project topic may take time and be difficult depending on the student. Once you and the student have agreed on a project topic help the student describe what the project is about, come up with a project name, identify the type of project and identify any research that will be needed.
